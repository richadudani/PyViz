![Toronto at night](Instructions/Images/real-estate-in-toronto.jpg)

## Summary

In this assignment, I have analyzed historical house values, dwelling types per neighbourhood, dwelling costs, top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods in Toronto Metropolitan Area, Ontario according to census data from 2001 to 2016. Additionally, I have also created a neighbourhood map using the location data from Mapbox and conducted a cost analysis of the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods per year using the sunburst chart.

Post the analysis, I have created a prototype dashboard for the Real Estate Investment division of Harrold’s company to provide customers with investment opportunities for the Toronto market. 

This dashboard's goal is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

The Dashboard Jupyter Notebook can be found at Instructions/Starter_Code/

2. Doubleclick and open the "run" shell script and see the dashboard in the Panel Application

3. For further details, the rental analysis can be seen in JupyterNotebook, Jupyterlab or VS Code. Rental Analysis Jupyter Notebook can be found at Instructions/Starter_Code/
